# Tips for Adelaide travel

## To and from the Aiport

Adelaide International Aiport is very close to the CBD, and only takes about 20 minutes by car or 35 minutes by bus.  
There are numerous options for transport into the CBD from the Airport including:

- Taxi  
- Adelaide Metro bus (See [below](#travelling-further) for more details)
- Car rental
- Ride sharing
- Shuttle buses
- And even bicycle!

For further details of these options, see the [Adelaide Aiport website](https://www.adelaideairport.com.au/parking-transport/transport-options/).

## Free Intra-CBD travel options

- The [tram in Adelaide](https://adelaidemetro.com.au/timetables/trams) is free to ride within the CBD boundaries and out to the Entertainment Centre.
- There is a free [City Connector bus](https://www.adelaidemetro.com.au/Timetables-Maps/Special-Services/Free-City-Services) which loops both directions around the CBD.
- There are also [Free Bikes](https://www.bikesa.asn.au/adelaidefreebikes) scattered around the CBD if pedal power is more your style. Adelaide is bike friendly with a very flat CBD and plenty of bike lanes.

## Travelling further 

- For those wanting to take public transport further afield, you will need a ticket. There are a few different options depending on your planned travel frequency and any Concession Cards accepted by Adelaide Metro that you hold.
    - An [Adelaide metrocard](https://www.adelaidemetro.com.au/Tickets-fares/metroCARD/Getting-a-metrocard) is a prepaid card which is best for frequent travellers longer than 3 days. They are sold [at most newsagents and some other convenience stores](https://www.adelaidemetro.com.au/Tickets-fares/Where-to-buy), but please note **you cannot buy a metrocard on board a bus, train or tram**, but you can *top up* a metrocard on a train or tram. A metrocard offers cheaper fares but they can only be topped up in increments of $5.00 however, and any remaining value is not refundable.
    - A [Visitor pass](https://www.adelaidemetro.com.au/Visitor-Pass-Campaign/Home) is a metrocard designed for visitors and provides unlimited travel over 3 consecutive days. Great for exploring the city over the weekend!
    - A daytrip ticket provides unlimited travel until 4am the morning after it is first validated. They can be purchased on board, and provide better value than single trip tickets for more than one trip on that day.
    - A single trip ticket is valid for up to 2 hours of travel. You can travel as many times as you want within the 2 hours, and they can be purchased onboard.
    - To compare the fares, visit the [Adelaide Metro website](https://www.adelaidemetro.com.au/Tickets-fares/Fares).
- The Adelaide Metro Website also has a [Journey Planner](https://www.adelaidemetro.com.au/planner/) to help with finding public transport to your desired destination. Google maps also does a pretty good job around Adelaide and suburbs.
