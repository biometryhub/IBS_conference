## Indoor Bouldering

##### 2:00 – 4:00pm

Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls, known as boulders, without the use of ropes or harnesses. While it can be done without any equipment, most climbers use climbing shoes to help secure footholds, chalk to keep their hands dry and provide a firmer grip, and bouldering mats to prevent injuries from falls.
A 2-hour bouldering session will take place at the Adelaide Bouldering Club. No experience is required and professional instruction and demonstration will be provided.

Also, for the climbing equipment, we have:

- Bouldering shoes hire available
- Bouldering chalk available
- No harness required
- Gym clothes and water are required

Cost: $20 pp, including shoes hire fees and transport
